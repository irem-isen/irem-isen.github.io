          <h2>BLOG - Is your personality really yours? </h2>
          <p class="description"> This <a href="medium.com/@iremisen/is-your-personality-really-yours-90f6bb17a313">blog post</a> is the first gate open for you to dive into my world. I am discussing
            my observations on social media, which I got hooked on much earlier than my peers, but nowadays cannot enjoy in peace.
            Join me in this discussion about the power social media holds today and what is means for us. </p>

          <h2>PODCAST - TedTalkers </h2>
          <p class="description">
            I don't listen to music in my free time. Rather, I do that when I am busy. If I have free time,
          I fill it up with ideas and information, and podcasts are perfect to access either. My favorite podcast?
          TedxTalks. And also my own podcast <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-418077237/final-podcast-project">here</a> ,
          where my groupmates and I discuss what makes a Ted Talk.</p>

          <h2>VIDEO - Turkish Rice Recipe </h2>
          <p class="description">
            A classic that always makes me happy:
            My grandmother's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Z5Qc1O_0&ab_channel=IremSen"> rice pilav</a> . I have prepared a detailed tutorial so you can also make this easy,
            rewarding recipe. I hope you find it heartwarming, too.

          <h2>OUTSIDE SOURCE - About Digital Hygiene</h2>
          <p class="description">
             We care so much about our physical hygiene, but have you heard of <a href= "https://networkcultures.org/blog/2021/05/12/digital-hygiene/"> digital hygiene</a>?
           For most of us, a considerable amount of daily life is online now. It is a great time to become aware and consider how
         healthy we are - digitally. </p>
